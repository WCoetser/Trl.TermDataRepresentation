# Description

*NB: THIS IS PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE*

_Trl.TermDataRepresentation_ aims to create a general-purpose data representation system based on the definition of terms. These terms will be easily accessable to parsing and automated theorem proving and will be human readable. The eventual aim of this data representation is to be on par with XML and JSON.
