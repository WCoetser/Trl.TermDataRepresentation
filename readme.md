# Description

*NB: Under construction*

The overall aim of this project is to represent  data in a way that roughly correspond to the definition of a _term_ in formal logic. (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Term_(logic))), and to create a term rewriting system that could be useful in everyday programming. _Terms_ should be familiar to any programmer because they are basically constants, variables, and function symbols.

# Installation via Nuget
